Introduction to *Preliminary Versions*
============

This is a collection of early versions of future sections,
in case you want to preview what is coming up in a week or two.

They are mostly one I wrote for a course I taught a few years ago, so sometimes assuming topics that are not prerequsites for this course, or referring to different text books and using different notation.
But apart from possible typos, they should be mathematically correct.
