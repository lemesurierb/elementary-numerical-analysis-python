    "The last step in producing an algorithm for solving the general case of $n$ simultaneous linear equations in $n$ variables that is *robust*, *efficient* and with good control of *rounding error* is to combine the ideas of [partial pivoting](simultaneous-linear-equations-2-pivoting.ipynb) (reordering the equations to avoid small pivot elements) and the [LU factorization](simultaneous-linear-equations-3-lu-factorization.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is sometimes described in three parts:\n",
    "- *permute* (reorder) the rows of the matirx $A$ by multiplying it at left by a suitable *permutation matrix* $P$; one with a single \"1\" in each row and each column and zeros elsewhere;\n",
    "- Get the LU factorization of this matrix: $PA = LU$.\n",
    "- To solve $A x = b$\n",
    "    - Express as $P A x = L U x = P b$ (whic just involves computing $Pb$, which just reorders the elements of $b$)\n",
    "    - Solve $L c = P b$ for $c$ by forward substitution\n",
    "    - Solve $U x = c$ for $x$ by backward substitution:\n",
    "      as before, this gives $L U x = L c = P b$ and $L U x = P A x$, so $PAx = Pb$;\n",
    "      since a permutation matrix $P$ is invertible (just unravel the row swaps), this ensures that $Ax = b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This give anice formuasin terms of matrices; however we can describe it a bit more compactly and efficiently by just talking about the permutation of the rows, described by a *permutation vector* — an $n$ component vector\n",
    "$\\pi = [\\pi_1, \\pi_2 , \\dots, \\pi_n]$\n",
    "whose elements are the integers from 1 to $n$ in some order.\n",
