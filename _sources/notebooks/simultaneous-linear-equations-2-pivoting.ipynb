    "\n",
    "We have noted two problems with the naive algorithm for Gaussian elimination: total failure due the division be zero, and loss of precision due to dividing by very small values — or more preciselt calculations the lead to intermediate values far larger than the final results.\n",
    "The culprits in all cases are the same: the denominators are first the *pivot elements* $a_{k,k}^{(k-1)}$ in evaluation of $l_{i,k}$ during row reduction and then the $u_{k,k}$ in back substitution.\n",
    "Further, those $a_{k,k}^{(k-1)}$ are the final updated values at indices $(k,k)$, so are the same as $u_{k,k}$.\n",
    "Thus it is exactly these *main diagonal elements* that we must deal with."

    "## The basic fix: Partial Pivoting\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic strategy is that at step $k$, we can swap equation $k$ with any equation $i$, $i > k$.\n",
    "Note that this involves swapping those rows of array `A` and also those elements of the array `b` for the right-hand side: $b_k \\leftrightarrow b_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach of swapping equations (swapping rows in arrays `A` and`b`) is called **pivoting**, or more specifically **partial pivoting**, to distinguish from the more elaborate strategy where to columns of `A` are also reordered (which is equivalent to reordeting the unknowns in the equations).\n",
    "The row that is swapped with row $k$ is sometimes called the **pivot row**, and the new denominator is the corresponding **pivot element**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is robust so long as one is using exact arithmetic: it works for any well-posed system because so long as the $Ax = b$ has a unique solution — so that the original matrix $A$ is non-singular — at least one of the $a_{i,k}^{(k-1)}, i \\geq k$ will be non-zero, and thus the swap will give a new element in position $(k,k)$ that is non-zero.\n",
    "(I will stop caring about superscripts to distinguish updates, but if you wish to, the elements of the new row $k$ could be called either $a_{k,j}^{(k)}$ or even $u_{k,j}$, since those values are in their final state.)"

    "The final refinement is to seek the smallest possible magnitudes for intermediate values, and thus the smallest absolute errors in them, by making the multipliers $l_{i,k}$ small, in turn by making the denominator $a_{k,k}^{(k-1)} = u_{k,k}$ as large as possible in magnitude:\n",
    "\n",
    "*At step $k$, choose the pivot row $p_k \\geq k$ so that $|a_{p_k,k}^{(k-1)}| \\geq |a_{i,k}^{(k-1)}|$ for all $i \\geq k$. If there is more that one such element of largest magnitude, use the lowest value:\n",
