    "\n",
    "The goal is to create Python functions for solving equations using the bisection method, and then to present the work in a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main mathematical objective is to solve an equation $f(x) = 0$ where the function $f:\\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is continuous on an interval $[a,b]$ and changes sign between its endpoints, so that a solution within that interval is guaranteed by the Intermediate Value Theorem.\n",

    "### Implementing the Improved Bisection Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The main programming task is to create a Python function whose input specifies a function `f`, the interval end-points `a` and `b`, and an upper limit `tol` on the allowable absolute error in the result; and whose output is both an approximate root `c` and a bound `errorBound` on its absolute error.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, we require that there is an exact root $r$ near $c$, in that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|r - c| \\leq \\text{errorBound} \\leq \\text{TOL}.$$\n",
