Introduction to *Python Preview*
============

This is a selection of notes on Python, particularly about using the packages [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) which might not have been encountered in a first course on Python programming.
These are excerpts from the Jupyter book *Python for Scientific Computing*, which might also be useful for review and reference.
