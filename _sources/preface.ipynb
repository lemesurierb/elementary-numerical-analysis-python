    "Some recent updates (most recent first):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Revised section [Solving Simultaneous Linear Equations, Part 1: Row Reduction/Gaussian Elimination](python_notebooks_modules/simultaneous-linear-equations-1-row-reduction.ipynb):\n",
    "    - added further uses of Python slicing and \"vectorization\" in a new version of function `rowReduction`,\n",
    "    - eliminated function `zeros_below_diagonal` in favor of always doing this in function `row_reduce`,\n",
    "    - fixed a few typos.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Revised section [Richardson Extrapolation](python_notebooks_modules/richardson-extrapolation.ipynb),\n",
    "adding an error estimate formula, and changing notation to avoid some reported confusions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Added hosting at GitHub at\n",

    "where there is now also an early version of\n",
    "[Python for Scientific Computing](https://lemesurierb.github.io/python-for-scientific-computing/intro.html)\n",
    "inrended for a programming lab course such as MATH 246 at the College of Charleston.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Updated section\n",
    "[Definite Integrals, Part 3](python_notebooks_modules/definite-integrals-3-simpson-richardson.ipynb),\n",
    "adding a derivation of Simpson's Rule using the Method of Undetermined Coefficients.\n",

    "[Definite Integrals, Part 1](python_notebooks_modules/definite-integrals-1-building-blocks.ipynb)\n",
    "and\n",
    "[Definite Integrals, Part 2](python_notebooks_modules/definite-integrals-2-composite-rules.ipynb),\n",
    "adding appendices on the (Composite) Left-hand Endpoint Rule.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Updated the module [numerical_methods_module](python_notebooks_modules/numerical_methods_module.ipynb) and to the notebook that generates it,\n",
    "adding \"demonstration modes\" to `rowReduce`, `backwardSubstitution` and `forwardSubstitution`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Added preliminary versions on ordinary differential equations and part 5 on simultaneous linear equations.\n",
