    "# Improving on the Above with Richardson Extrapolation\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function to apply Richardson extrapolation using the above centered differences function, and a file to test it and handle any interactive input and screen or file output, as noted above.\n",
    "As with almost any practical implementation of a numerical approximation algorithm, the input should include an **error tolerance**, and the output should include an **error estimate**."

    "It could help to break this into to \"sub-tasks\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python function that does a single step of RIchardson extrapolation, and add code to test this with an example like the suggested $f(x) = e^x$, $f'(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a second function that uses a (while) loop to seek the error tolerance, halving $h$ at each iteration.\n",
    "Use a while loop, or my strategy of using a `for` loop to impose an iteration limit and withinit a `break` to stop if and when sufficient accuracy is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, see the updated notes on Richardson Extrapolation, where I have added a discussion of how to get error estimates."
