    "# Improving on the Centered Difference Approximaiton with Richardson Extrapolation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Slightly revised on Thursday March 25**\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function to apply Richardson extrapolation using the above centered differences function, and a file to test it and handle any interactive input and screen or file output, as noted above.\n",
    "\n",
    "As with almost any practical implementation of a numerical approximation algorithm, the input should include an **error tolerance**, and the output should include an **error estimate**."

    "## Further details and suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "It could help to break this into to \"sub-tasks\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a Python function (maybe `CD_richardson_1(f, x, h`?) that does a single step of Richardson extrapolation forth centered difference approximation of the first derivative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then as usual add a code cell with testing of this on some examples such as $f(x) = e^x$, $f'(1)$ as suggested in the section on [Test Cases for Differentiation](test-cases-differentiation.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a second function that uses a (while) loop to seek an result tht meets the error tolerance, halving $h$ at each iteration.\n",
    "Use a while loop â€” or my strategy of using a `for` loop to impose an iteration limit and within that a `break` to stop if and when sufficient accuracy is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, see the updated notes on Richardson Extrapolation, where I have added a discussion of how to get error estimates."
