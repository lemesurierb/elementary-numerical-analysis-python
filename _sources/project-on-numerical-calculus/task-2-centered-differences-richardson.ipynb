    "# Improving on the above with Richardson extrapolation\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function to apply Richardson extrapolation using the above centered differences function, and a file to test it and handle any interactive input and screen or file output, as noted above.\n",
    "As with almost any practical implementation of a numerical approximation algorithm, the input should include an **error tolerance**, and the output should include an **error estimate**."

    "1. Write a Python function that does a single step of RIchardson extrapolation, and add cdeo testing this with an example like the suggested $f(x) = e^x$, $f'(1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a second function that uses a (while) loop to seek teh eror tolerqnce, halving $h$ at each iteration. th a whie loop or my strategy of usint a `for` loop to impose an iteration limit and a `break` to stop if and when sufficient accuracy is achieved.\n",
