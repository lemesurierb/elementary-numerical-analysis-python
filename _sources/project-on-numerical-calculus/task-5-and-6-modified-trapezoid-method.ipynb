    "\n",
    "Then iteration in pursuit of an error tolerance (doubling $n$ until the estimated error is small enough) could be done as a refinement.\n",

    "computing $T_1', T_2', T_4', \\dots, T_{2^m}'$.\n",
    "- Then revise to add an error estimate (e.g the difference between the two most recent approximations) and exit the `for` loop early with a `break` if and when the error estimate is small enough."
