# Full Disclosure: Things I Plan to do to Expand and Improve This Book

- An introduction to iterative methods for simultaneous linear equations.

- An introduction to methods for *eigen-problems*: computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

- An introduction to fitting curves to data with least squares (minimizing the root-mean-square ["RMS"] error).

- Incorporating the two numerical examples on Euler's Method from the Runge-Kutta section back into the Euler's Method section.
