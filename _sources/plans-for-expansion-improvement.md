Full Disclosure: Things I Plan to do to Expand and Improve This Book
===============

- Notes on minimization (mostly without derivatives).

- Notes on fitting curves to data with least squares (minimizing the root-mean-square ["RMS"] error)

- Incorporate the two numerical examples on Euler's Method from the Runge-Kutta section back into the Euler's Method section.
